## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What if the photo doesn't capture all students?**
A: No problem! The system shows you exactly which students were missed, and you can mark them manually with their photos for verification.

**Q: What if lighting is poor?**
A: The system adapts to different lighting conditions. In very poor light, more students might need manual marking, but it's still faster than traditional methods.

**Q: Can students cheat this system?**
A: No. Students must be physically present in the classroom photo. Unlike RFID cards, photos cannot be shared or faked.

**Q: What if a student arrives late?**
A: Take another photo, or mark them manually. The system allows multiple photos per day and manual additions.

**Q: How much technical training is needed?**
A: Minimal. Teachers need about 15 minutes of training. The interface is designed to be very simple.

**Q: What if the computer crashes?**
A: All data is automatically saved. You can continue from where you left off, or use manual backup methods.
